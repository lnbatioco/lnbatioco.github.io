Hello everyone, my name is Lory! 

I am a sociology student with aspirations of becoming a software developer in the field of educational technology, often referred to as “EdTech”. The area of EdTech I am most fascinated by encompasses the purpose, impact, and potential of online learning technology. *Education transforms lives*. It has the capacity to empower individuals and communities economically in addition to reducing social inequalities. The maturity of internet and digital technologies partnered with higher educational institutions have made it possible to deliver instructional programs across the world! According to Dr. Anthony Picciano, a leading researcher in online education, this partnership: broadened student access to education, enabled the incorporation of multimedia to improve online learning environments, boosted faculty and student connectivity through social media, and gave research institutions a way to share their expertise. I envision my professional future in developing learning platforms that continue to enhance learning and teaching.  
		
To make my aspirations a reality I study Full Stack Web Development at Flatiron School to acquire technical skills involved in creating software while also pursuing my Sociology degree from San Francisco State University. Pursuing my degree in sociology is invaluable to cultivating my comprehension in social problem solving. Furthermore, I read EdTech articles on a weekly basis not only to stay informed about its current events, but also remain open minded and excited about its future.
